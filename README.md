# VEHICULAR ODD-EVEN COMPLIANCE AND E-CHALLAN GENERATION

Pollution in India is a definite offshoot of many other environmental problems - be it air, water, land, or noise. One major source of environmental emissions are cars. India needs smarter transportation options as well, and this is where startups can pitch in apart from other ways to tackle pollution. We will be designing a system, based on an Odd-Even formula to control traffic. Odd- Even formula stated that vehicle with odd numbers license plate will ply on odd dates and those with even numbers license plate will ply on even dates.
